## How to Use 🚀

### 1. Create a Trent file

Any location works, but for organization, a `trents` directory might be nice, in case your want multiple for different features

```txt
~/lib/trents/calculator_trent.dart
```

Add the package import

```dart
import 'package:trent/trent.dart';
```

### 2. Add Your States

A base state

```dart
class CalculatorStates extends Equatable {
  @override
  List<Object> get props => [];
}
```

All your calculator states extend from the base state

```dart
todo
```
